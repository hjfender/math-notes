\subsection{Dihedral Group}\label{dihedralgroup}

\subsubsection{Definition}

Intuitively, this group captures the rigid motions (flips and rotations) of regular polygons in the $2$D plane. It is denoted
$D_{2n}$, where $n$ is the number of sides/angles of the polygon, and contains $2n$ elements, $n$ rotations and $n$ flips.
