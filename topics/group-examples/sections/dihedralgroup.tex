\subsection{Dihedral Group}\label{dihedralgroup}

\subsubsection{Definition}

Intuitively, this group captures the rigid motions (flips and rotations) of regular polygons in the $2$D plane. It is denoted
$D_{2n}$, where $n$ is the number of sides/angles of the polygon, and contains $2n$ elements, $n$ rotations and $n$ flips.

\subsubsection{Presentation}

$\langle x,y | x^2, y^n, xyxy \rangle$

\begin{proposition}
Let $q$ be an odd prime, and let $G$ be a noncommutative group of order $2q$. Then $G \cong D_{2q}.$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Cauchy's theorem, $\exists y \in G$ such that $y$ has order $q$. By the third Sylow theorem, $\langle y \rangle$ is the unique subgroup of order $q$ in $G$ (and is therefore normal).
Since $G$ is not commutative and in particular it is not cyclic, it has no elements of order $2q$; therefore, every element in the complement of $\langle y \rangle$ has order $2$; let $x$
be any such element.

The conjugate $xyx^{-1}$ of $y$ by $x$ is an element of order $q$, so $xyx^{-1} \in \langle y \rangle$. Thus, $xyx^{-1} = y^r$ for some $r$ between $0$ and $q - 1$.

Now observe that\dots
$$(y^r)^r = (xyx^{-1})^r = xy^rx^{-1} = x^2 y (x^{-1})^2 = y$$
since $|x| = 2$. Therefore, $y^{r^2 - 1} = e$, which implies\dots
$$q | (r^2 - 1) = (r-1)(r+1)$$
by \ref{orderasfirstidentityproducer}. Since $q$ is prime, this says that $q | (r-1)$ or $q | (r+1)$; since $0 \leq r \leq q - 1$, it follows that $r = 1$ or $r = q - 1$.

If $r = 1$, then $xyx^{-1} = y$; that is, $xy = yx$. But then the order of $xy$ is $2q$, and $G$ is cyclic, a contradiction.

Therefore $r = q - 1$, and we have established the relations\dots
\[
	\begin{cases}
	x^2 = e, \\
	y^q = e, \\
	yx = xy^{q-1}.
	\end{cases}
\]
\end{proof}
These are the relations satisfied by generators $x,y$ of $D_{2q}$; the statement follows.
