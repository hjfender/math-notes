\subsection{Dihedral Group}\label{dihedralgroup}

\subsubsection{Definition}

Intuitively, this group captures the rigid motions (flips and rotations) of regular polygons in the $2$D plane. It is denoted
$D_{2n}$, where $n$ is the number of sides/angles of the polygon, and contains $2n$ elements, $n$ rotations and $n$ flips.

\begin{proposition}
Let $q$ be an odd prime, and let $G$ be a noncommutative group of order $2q$. Then $G \cong D_{2q}.$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Cauchy's theorem, $\exists y \in G$ such that $y$ has order $q$.
\end{proof}
