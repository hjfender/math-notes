\subsection{Free Algebras}\label{freealgebras}
A free $R$-algebra on the set $A$, $F^{R-alg}(A)$, an $R$-algebra together with a set
function $j : A \rightarrow F^{R-alg}(A)$ making the following diagram commute.

\begin{proposition}
$R[A]$ is a free commutative $R$-algebra on the set $A$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We have to show that $R[A]$ satisfies the diagram above. Since $S$ is an $R$-algebra, we have a fixed homomorphism
of ring $\alpha : R \rightarrow S$. Then we may construct $\varphi : R[A] = R[x_1,\dots,x_n] \rightarrow S$ by extending
$\alpha$ $n$ times: extending $R[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ to $R[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ mapping $x_n$ to $f(n)$. Note that each extension
is uniquely determined by its requirements.

It is fairly simple to show that $\varphi$ is the required homomorphism past this point.
\end{proof}

\subsubsubsection{Finite Type}\label{finitetype}
The module $M$ is of \emph{finite type} if there is an onto homomorphism of $R$-algebras\dots
$$R[x_1,\dots,x_n] \twoheadrightarrow S.$$
