(See: \hyperref[setaxioms]{set axioms})

\begin{theorem}[Axiom of Choice]
The following statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For any relation $R$, there is a function $F \subseteq R$ with dom $F =$ dom $R$.
  \item The Cartesian product of nonempty sets is always nonempty. That is, if $H$ is a function with
  domain $I$ and if $(\forall i \in I)H(i) \neq \emptyset$, then there is a function $f$ with domain $I$
  such that $(\forall i \in I) f(i) \in H(i).$
  \item For any set $A$ there is a function $F$ (a "choice function"\label{choicefunction} for $A$) such
  that $F(B) \in B$ for every nonempty $B \subseteq A$.
  \item Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set such that (a) each member of $\mathcal{A}$ is a nonempty set, and (b) any 
  two distinct members of $\mathcal{A}$ are disjoint. Then there exists a set $C$ containing exactly one element
  from each member of $\mathcal{A}$ (i.e., for each $B \in \mathcal{A}$ the set $C \cap B$ is a singleton $\{ x \}$
  for some $x$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\noindent There are other theorems that are equivalent to the axiom of choice.

\begin{theorem}[Cardinal Comparability]\label{cardinalcomparability}
For any sets $C$ and $D$, either $C \preceq D$ or $D \preceq C$. For any two cardinal numbers $\kappa$ and $\lambda$,
either $\kappa \leq \lambda$ or $\lambda \leq \kappa$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Zorn's Lemma]\label{zornslemma}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set such that for every chain $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$, we have $\bigcup \mathcal{B} \in \mathcal{A}$.
($\mathcal{B}$ is called a \emph{chain}\label{chain} if and only if for any $C$ and $D$ in $\mathcal{B}$, either $C \subseteq D$ or $D \subseteq C$.)
Then $\mathcal{A}$ contains an element $M$ (a "maximal" element) such that $M$ is not a subset of any other set in $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{theorem}
