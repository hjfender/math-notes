\subsection{Topological Properties}\label{topologicalproperties}
A property of a space $\langle X,\mathcal{T}_X \rangle$ is said to be a \emph{topological property} if, whenever $\langle Y, \mathcal{T}_Y \rangle$ is homeomorphic to $\langle X,\mathcal{T}_X \rangle$, then the space $\langle Y,\mathcal{T}_Y \rangle$
also has the property.

\subsubsection{First Countable}\label{firstcountable}
A topological space is \emph{first countable} if for each $x \in X$ there is a collection of open sets $\{ U^x_i | i = 1,2,3,\dots \}$ such that,
for any $V$ open in $X$ with $x \in V$, there is one of these open sets $U^x_j$ with $x \in U^x_j \subseteq V$.

\subsubsection{Second Countable}\label{secondcountable}
A space that has a \hyperref[countable]{countable} set as a basis for its topology.

\subsubsection{Connectedness}
Connectedness is a topological property.

\subsubsection{Connected Componenents}
The cardinality of the set of connected components of a space $X$ is a topological invariant.

\subsubsection{Path-connectedness}
Path-connectedness is a topological property.

\subsubsection{Fundamental Group}
The fundamental group is a topological invariant of a space.
