\subsection{Topological Properties}\label{topologicalproperties}
A property of a space $\langle X,\mathcal{T}_X \rangle$ is said to be a \emph{topological property} if, whenever $\langle Y, \mathcal{T}_Y \rangle$ is homeomorphic to $\langle X,\mathcal{T}_X \rangle$, then the space $\langle Y,\mathcal{T}_Y \rangle$
also has the property.

\subsubsection{Second Countable}\label{secondcountable}
A space that has a \hyperref[countable]{countable} set as a basis for its topology.
