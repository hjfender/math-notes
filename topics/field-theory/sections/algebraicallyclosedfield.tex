\subsection{Algebraically Closed Fields}\label{algebraicallyclosedfields}
A field $k$ is \emph{algebraically closed} if all irreducible polynomials in $k[x]$ have degree $1$.

\begin{lemma}
A field $k$ is algebraically closed if and only if every nonconstant polynomial $f \in k[x]$ factors completely as a product of linear factors, if and only if
every nonconstant polynomial $f \in k[x]$ has a root in $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Then $k$ is infinite.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Adapt Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes.
