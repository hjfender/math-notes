\subsection{Algebraically Closed Fields}\label{algebraicallyclosedfields}
A field $k$ is \emph{algebraically closed} if all irreducible polynomials in $k[x]$ have degree $1$.

\begin{lemma}
A field $k$ is algebraically closed if and only if every nonconstant polynomial $f \in k[x]$ factors completely as a product of linear factors, if and only if
every nonconstant polynomial $f \in k[x]$ has a root in $k$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Then $k$ is infinite.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Adapt Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Polynomials Over Fields}

\begin{proposition}
Every polynomial $f \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ of degree $\geq 3$ is reducible.

The nonconstant irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ are precisely the polynomials
of degree $1$ and the quadratic polynomials\dots
$$f = ax^2 + bx + c$$
with $b^2 - 4ac < 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Use the fundamental theorem of algebra and apply complex conjugation to any complex root to find a linear factor.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Every polynomial $f \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ of odd degree has a real root.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
Let $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be a primitive polynomial, and let $p$ be a prime integer. Assume $f$ mod $p$
has the same degree as $f$ and is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Then $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
There are irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of arbitrarily large degree.
\end{corollary}
