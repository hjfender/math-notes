\subsection{Fundamental Group}\label{fundamentalgroup}

\begin{theorem}
Composition of loops induces a group structure on $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ with identity element $[s_{x_0}(t)]$ and inverses given by $[\lambda]^{-1} = [\lambda^{-1}]$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is called the \emph{fundamental group of} $X$ \emph{at the base point} $x_0$.

\begin{theorem}
Let $(X,x_0)$ and $(Y,y_0)$ be pointed spaces. Then $\pi_1(X \times Y, (x_0,y_0))$ is isomorphic to $\pi_1(X,x_0) \times \pi_1(Y,y_0)$, the direct product of these two groups.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
If $G$ is a topological group, then $\pi_1(G, e)$ is an abelian group.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
$\pi_1(S^1, 1)$ is abelian.
\end{corollary}
