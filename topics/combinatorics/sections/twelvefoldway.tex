\subsection{Twelvefold Way}\label{twelvefoldway}

There are $12$ fundamental counting problems. Sometimes they are formulated in terms of putting \emph{balls} into \emph{baskets}.\newline

Let $N$ and $X$ be finite sets\dots

\subsubsection{Functions from $N$ to $X$}

Count with sequences of $|N|$ elements in $X$ ($|^NX|$).

\subsubsection{Injections from $N$ to $X$}

Count with \hyperref[k-list]{n-lists} ($(|X|)_n$).

\subsubsection{Surjections from $N$ to $X$}

Count with
