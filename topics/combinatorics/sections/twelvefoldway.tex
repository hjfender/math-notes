\subsection{Twelvefold Way}\label{twelvefoldway}

There are $12$ fundamental counting problems. Sometimes they are formulated in terms of putting \emph{balls} into \emph{baskets}.\newline

Let $N$ and $K$ be finite sets and $n$ and $k$ be their cardinality respectively\dots

\subsubsection{Functions from $K$ to $N$}

Count with sequences of $k$ elements in $N$, $|^KN|$.

\subsubsection{Injections from $K$ to $N$}

Count with \hyperref[k-list]{$k$-lists}, $(n)_k$.

\subsubsection{Surjections from $K$ to $N$}

Count with the \hyperref[secondstirlingnumbers]{number of surjections} from $[k]$ to $[n]$, $\sum^n_{j=0} (-1)^j {n \choose j} (n-j)^k$.

\subsubsection{Injections from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $K$}

Count \hyperref[countingsubsets]{subsets}, \hyperref[k-list]{$k$-lists} without order, ${n \choose k}$.

\subsubsection{Functions from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $K$}

Count \hyperref[multisets]{multisets} with $k$ elements from $N$, ${n + k - 1 \choose k}$.

\subsubsection{Surjections from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $K$}

Count \hyperref[compositions]{compositions} of $k$ into $n$ parts, ${k - 1 \choose n - 1}$.

\subsubsection{Injections from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $N$}

Provided $k \leq n$, there is only $1$ of these.

\subsubsection{Surjections from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $N$}

Count \hyperref[secondstirlingnumbers]{partitions} of $K$ into $n$ non-empty subsets, $S(k,n)$.

\subsubsection{Functions from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $N$}

Count all the partitions of $K$ up to $n$ classes, $\sum_{i=0}^n {k \choose i}$. If $k \leq n$, \hyperref[bellnumbers]{$B(k)$}.

\subsubsection{Functions from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $K$ and $N$}

Count \hyperref[integerpartitions]{partitions} of $k$ into $\leq n$ non-empty subsets, $\sum^n_{i=0}p_i(k)$.

\subsubsection{Injections from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $K$ and $N$}

Provided $k \leq n$, there is only $1$ of these.

\subsubsection{Surjections from $K$ to $N$, up to a permutation of $K$ and $N$}

Count \hyperref[integerpartitions]{partitions} of $k$ into $n$ non-empty subsets, $p_n(k)$.
