\subsection{Twelvefold Way}\label{twelvefoldway}

There are $12$ fundamental counting problems. Sometimes they are formulated in terms of putting \emph{balls} into \emph{baskets}.\newline

Let $N$ and $K$ be finite sets and $n$ and $k$ be their cardinality respectively\dots

\subsubsection{Functions from $K$ to $N$}

Count with sequences of $k$ elements in $N$, $|^KN|$.

\subsubsection{Injections from $K$ to $N$}

Count with \hyperref[k-list]{k-lists}, $(n)_k$.
